## Summary
Incognito is an activity-based social media app that allows for location-based messages, called “secrets,” which are both created and read by users nearby.  This app aims to cultivate a sense of community and excitement in this booming era of faceless social media.

## Technical Description
Incognito is for the user who wants an alternative social media experience – something that is interactive, low-commitment, and community-based. Users can remain anonymous, but are encouraged to engage with their fellow users. Upon login, users are directed to a Google-based map which determines their current location and displays nearby secrets.  The user can click a secret to expand and read its contents and comments.  Additionally the user can post a secret to a specific, physical location for others to read.  On their profile page a dashboard containing the user's basic information is provided along with the secrets they have posted. Personal information is hidden from the public.
