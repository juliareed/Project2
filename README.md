## Summary
Incognito is an activity-based social media app that allows for location-based messages, called “secrets,” which are both created and read by users nearby.  Incognito aims to cultivate a sense of community and excitement in this booming era of faceless social media.

## Technical Description
Incognito is for the user who wants an alternative social media experience – something that is interactive, low-commitment, and community-based. Users can remain anonymous, but are encouraged to engage with their community. Upon login, a dashboard containing the users basic information is provided. Personal information is hidden from the public. Users have access to the number of secrets they have posted, comments on their secrets, secrets they have read, and comments they have posted. Below their personal profile users can search their current location to load a Google-based map displaying nearby secrets. The user can click a secret to expand and read its contents and comments. Additionally the user can post a secret to a specific, physical location for others to read.
